### About this site

Hi, this is a page for introductory to Qinyao Wu. You can find my emails and my github page here, as well as my previous education and professional experiences and my resume. 

Sometimes you need to say a bit about the site -- how it was made, where it's hosted, where the source code can be found. 

If this is for a project or analysis, I recommend giving some details about the R package versions that you used to create the content.
